# Raveo
Raveo typeface is a warmer version of the open-source Inter typeface. Inter is one of the highest quality typefaces around. It is almost the default for digital products nowadays. This project builds on top of Inter with a fork that shifts it slightly towards imperfection and human touch, while doubling down on the sturdiness.

### New characters
There are a few redrawn letters.
- Lowercase “a” with a tail.
- Uppercase “R” with a curled leg.

### Baked stylistic choices
Raveo uses some characters from Inter’s stylistic sets, like the “G” with a spur, by default. This is baked in.

### Shifted weights
The locations of the most commonly used named weights on the variable weight axis are moved. This results in slightly darker appearance. You can use numbers to overwrite this to the classic Inter weight locations (e.g. 500 will get you the same weight as in Inter Medium).
In Raveo, the named weight changes are:
- Regular remains 400
- Medium is 520 instead of 500
- SemiBold is 630 instead of 600
- Bold is 730 instead of 700

### Subsetted weights
Raveo is distributed mainly with subsetted weights to the range between Regular–Bold. This way, the variable font file is around 100 KB. This should cover most of use cases for the web. Full set is also available. The font remains variable.

### Other modifications
The whole glyph set is heavily subsetted towards extended latin.
