# Variable fonts
For web use, there are two distributions:
- *RaveoVF.woff2* has the whole character set and is about 150 KB.
- *RaveoVF-subsetted.woff2* only covers the weight range of Regular–Bold (400–730) and is about 100 KB.

If you don’t need very thin and very heavy weights, I recommend the subsetted version – it’s smaller.
The desktop version, *Raveo-VF.ttf*, has the full weight range.
